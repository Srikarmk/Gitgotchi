# GitGotchi Project Voice & Style

## Code Style

- Python 3.10+ with type hints
- Rich library for all terminal output
- Async where beneficial (git operations)
- Comprehensive docstrings

## Narrative Voice

- Spooky but playful (not genuinely scary)
- Puns and wordplay encouraged
- Reference classic horror tropes
- Keep it wholesome-creepy (no gore)

## Error Handling

- Never crash, always graceful degradation
- Errors should have spooky flavor text
- Log everything for debugging

## Example Messages

- Pet hungry: "Your ghost is fading... feed it with commits!"
- Pet happy: "Your spectral companion purrs with ethereal delight"
- Evolution: "Something stirs in the darkness... your pet is evolving!"
- Error: "The spirits are restless... (git repository not found)"

## Terminology

- Commits = "feeding" the pet
- Code quality = "spiritual energy"
- Merge conflicts = "dark magic"
- Reverts = "necromancy"
- Evolution = "manifestation"
